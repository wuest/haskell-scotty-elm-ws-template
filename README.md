## Haskell + Scotty + Elm + Websockets = <3

This repository puts forth a barebones skeleton application useful in cases
where a Haskell server and Elm 0.19 frontend are desired, particularly if
Websockets are needed.

### Usage

The contents of this repository can be built out of the box.  As such, to get
started on a new application:

 * Clone the repository
 * `rm -rf .git`
 * `git init`
 * Edit the `.cabal` file to reflect the application's information
 * `make`

The Makefile is generic, so updates to the cabal file and `src/Const.hs` are
sufficient to be reflected automatically in the make targets.

### Assumptions

The `Makefile` in particular makes a few assumptions:

 * `ghc` gets invoked directly - if invocation via `stack` is required, then it
   will be necessary to tweak it.
 * `elm` is in the path
 * `cabal` is expected to be of a sufficiently new version to support Nix-style
   builds (`v2-*` commands)

### License

This code is intended to be used as a template, and as such I consider it to be
released as Public Domain.  My sincere hope is that others find this useful and
that it saves them time getting started.

Due to the [the documented issues with releasing software into the Public
Domain][license0], this code is also released under the BSD license.  My intent
is to attach the license so that areas where the law surrounding the use of
Public Domain law is uncertain, the BSD license provides an appropriate
framework around which a developer can base their assumptions regarding the use
of this template.
